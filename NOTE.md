Define a "Sampler_Cache" where one can ask for a pair of sampler and texture and know if there's already a match, and if not append the pair

Define a "Batch" that defines a shader, its parameters (for example textures, samplers and a camera) just like vertices and indices

Define a "Shader_Params" as a Uniform Buffer to send "arbitrary" data to a shader
